# Portfolio-optimization
This project features a Python notebook that optimizes a 10-stock portfolio using Monte Carlo simulation, with historical stock data sourced from Yahoo Finance and stored in a .csv file. The repository includes the notebook for analysis and the raw data used in the optimization process.

## Repository Structure
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and visualization.
- `data/`: Original datasets (CSV files) used in the analysis.

## Installation
To run this project, you can use Google Colab, which allows you to execute the Jupyter notebook in the cloud without any local setup. Follow these steps:

1. **Open the Notebook in Google Colab**:
   Click on the following link to open the notebook directly in Google Colab:
   [Open Portfolio Optimization Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/your-username/portfolio-optimization/blob/main/portfolio_optimization.ipynb)

2. **Upload the Data File**:
   The notebook requires a `.csv` file for the analysis. You can upload the file directly in Google Colab by following these steps:
   - Run the code cell that contains the upload command (typically using `files.upload()` from `google.colab`).
   - Choose the `.csv` file from your local machine when prompted.

3. **Run the Notebook Cells**:
   Once the data file is uploaded, run the code cells in order:
   - To run a cell, click on it and press `Shift + Enter` or click the "Run" button in the notebook toolbar.
   - The notebook will perform data preprocessing and execute the Monte Carlo simulation using the uploaded data.

4. **View the Results**:
   After running all the cells, you will see the simulation results, portfolio optimization output, and various visualizations, such as:
   - Monte Carlo simulated returns
   - Optimal portfolio allocation
   - Visual graphs showing risk vs. return trade-offs

## Running the Notebooks
The notebook in the `notebooks/` folder provides a portfolio optimization.


## Data Files
The project uses datasets stored in the `data/` folder.



- `final_report.md`: A summary of the loan portfolio valuation findings and recommendations.
